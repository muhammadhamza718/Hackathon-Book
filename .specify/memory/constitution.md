# Constitution: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This document serves as the foundational charter for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book project. It outlines the target audience, technology stack, focus areas, and core principles that will guide the development of the book.

## 1. Target Audience

-   **Researchers:** Those interested in the latest advancements in AI and robotics.
-   **Engineers:** Professionals looking to implement AI solutions in physical systems.
-   **Students:** Upper-level undergraduate and graduate students studying AI, robotics, or related fields.
-   **Industry Professionals:** Individuals seeking to understand the practical applications of AI in humanoid robotics.

The book assumes a beginner to intermediate level of knowledge in AI and robotics. Readers are expected to have a basic understanding of programming, linear algebra, and calculus. Some familiarity with machine learning concepts is helpful but not required.

## 2. Tech Stack

-   **Docusaurus:** A modern static website generator will be used to create the book's documentation.

    *   *Justification:* Docusaurus is selected because it is easy to maintain open-source documentation websites. It leverages React to create interactive, single-page applications with features like versioning, internationalization, and search.

## 3. Focus Areas

-   **Hands-on Learning:** The book will emphasize practical, project-based learning. Each module will include hands-on projects that allow readers to apply the concepts they have learned.
-   **Real-World Applications:** The book will focus on the practical applications of AI in humanoid robotics. It will cover topics such as robot control, simulation, perception, and human-robot interaction.
-   **Integration of Theory and Practice:** The book will integrate theoretical concepts with practical examples. It will provide readers with a solid foundation in both the theory and practice of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## 4. Core Principles

-   **Clarity:** The book will be written in a clear and concise style.
-   **Accuracy:** The book will be technically accurate and up-to-date.
-   **Relevance:** The book will focus on the most relevant and important topics in Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
-   **Engagement:** The book will be engaging and interactive, encouraging readers to actively participate in the learning process.
